This app is not working in my Samsung Galaxy Alpha I don't know why when I open the app it says update this app and when I tap ok it shows the update is not available kindly tell me what's the issue,Usability
Uses more battery then the screen. I have asked for help and receive no replies,Performance
Doesn't work for me. But great UI,Usability
A widgit that reminds of you of calorie balance on the front screen would be nice the app has definitely improved for me,Usability
When I use the app I think it can turn on and my phone turn off,Usability
"I love it!!It's the best app ever! But I can't sign in with my account, I don't know why Anyway 5 stars,amazimg app",Usability

Nice app...??,Usability
it's real blood pressure checker.it's useful and u can use it anywhere.i like it.easy to use.but something can' understand how to use.,Usability
I do not use it. I would like to uninstall but it is not as simple as when I installed it. Why is it more difficult to uninstall?,Usability
Great app,Security
no way to turn off auto hr,Usability
It's in accurate and it's frustrating to have to sit through video adds immediately before viewing my results.,Usability
More difficult to get to other metrics,Usability
"I cannot connect this thing to my watch despite the instructions I had to set up, which didn't even work for my J7 Prime phone and my gear fit 2. No clear instructions on how to set things up.",Usability
The app has stopped working,Usability
The newest version is constantly creating on my note 8 saying that the new security features do not support rooted device. I have never rooted the device... pls fix,Security
"Utterly useless, app tells me 1 thing, watch tells me another. This app is entirely pointless, I'm better off using the web app.",Usability
Latest version app as of 12/8/16 works well. Just need to sort out swimming tracking. If you swim too fast it doesn't track.,Performance
"-1 start : Blood pressure graphics is very bad, difficult tu read. Rework need! And adding measurement is annoying by number already present !!!",Usability
"Something is wrong with this app lately. It becomes slow and unresponsive, even freezing the entire system. Can't use it anymore.",Performance
Why the app asking for birthdate? Threat to personal info. security.,Security
Full of ads and that is a problem....but everything else is very great indeed.?,Usability
"Great app. I use it everyday. I was able to connect my Water reminder app with this. Not sure if the update is to blame, but I can't search new food without entering manually or notify the app team. Please Fix!",Usability
Not accurate with steps count,Usability
The application never has the same steps listed as my S-Health. Updating is painfully slow and lags. Same with integration to Google Fit.,Usability
I don't know why people give this a low rating. This app motivated me to workout anf the actice recording showed me an overall view of my activities every day. It also has a motivating quote that changes everyday if you integrate it in the smart bulletin on your LG phone.,Usability
Is a must have by default,Usability
The app doesn't track the work out and steps correctly. It's very far off. My Samsung app tracks every single step I take but google fit doesn't. There are very little function. It allows you to enter the length of work out but you have to enter the calories burned yourself. That's stupid.,Usability
Probably less clear then before. Seems a little more performant though.,Usability
"Works great but synching speed and experience is atrocious compared to iOS, please improve.",Performance
Uses too much power since last update. Biggest drain of all my apps,Performance
I thought the work out looked too easy but try to keep up with timing and rest periods and you will find it is actually quite challenging.,Usability
not work,Performance
Disappointed say the least. if u by accident u uninstall all data is lost I had mega personal info I used daily all gone. Not going bother useing again. Really angry?,Usability
I normally love fit but the new version crashes on my moto 360 (2nd edition) every 3 seconds. So I will have to un-install until it is fixed.,Usability
This update version sucks I don't like or understand it. I really enjoyed the latest version. I unstalled google fit and it really help me and encourage me to keep going. ??,Usability
It adds steps even when I'm just sitting doing nothing! Not helpful when trying to keep track of daily steps at all.,Usability
"Really good app, though can't understand why the android version doesn't tell you what badge is coming up next on the step counter like the apple version",Usability
Try it,Usability
I really dislike the look of the logo for this app. I don't get inspired by it at all.,Usability
Graphs thats are not clear what you have achieved for the day and use too many colours that make it confusing. Please hire a ux designer to solve this horrible app,Usability
Device not rooted but when I open app it says it is and app won't work?,Usability
It's not working .. it keeps saying samsung health with knox and im waiting for this when it's completed it says that there is no network connection .. please help.,Usability

"It's not the most useful app on the world, but that would be forgivable if it weren't so UGLY. The color palate is a total mess, and the artwork is oddly discomforting as well. What were they thinking?",Usability
"I used to think this app was better than Mapmy walk. Lately, it just does whatever it wants. The updates have made it impossible for me to figure out how to recreate settings. Recently, it just wiped itself out and obliterated all the stored data. I did nothing to ask for this. Just woke up one day and everything changed. Also, I often have to restart my phone in order to get the step app to kick in in the morning. I usually like to start the walking app, and let it tell me how far I walked and what pace. Now all it will do is tell me I walked 0.0 miles but it will tell me what pace I walked. It also has some preconceived notion of what my workout is, which I can't figure out how to change. So, to recap. I absolutely used to love it. Now I hated it. but then I got good customer care support and I was happy however this week, again I updated and the app is wonky again.",Performance
Why can't I delete this app,Usability
App is constantly running in the background. It kills my phone.,Performance
"Looks good, but steps counter sometimes ignores hours of walking. Also, synchronization between multiple devices is not seamless.",Usability

I am just trying to put in my password and the captcha like box that is supposed to have letters in it is completely blank.So now that i have found the right password i can not enter it because that box is empty.,Usability
"I loved the previous version even more. It's great to play the game of making the daily targets, but the new Timeline often takes minutes to display.",Performance
Last update is a battery drain. Keeps my device awake all the time. Uninstalled. Update: Installed again latest version. Same battery drain issue.,Performance

Home screen need improvement. Activity tracking disabled info annoying. No activity graph on home screen.,Usability
Why can't I at least disable it?!?! I hate bloatware taking up space on my phone.,Usability
This app is essentially what My Tracks should have been. It's dead simple and tracks everything you would expect. It even does a decent job of tracking your activities when you forget to tell it to start tracking. My only complaint is that it makes it difficult to find your top speed when biking/running.,Usability
"It's great that you can connect other apps to it. So you don't have to run many apps for counting your steps and... But the it's not that intelligent, even when I use GPS, it can't automatically detect when I'm running, when im not. I was laying on bed, almost for an hour, I've noticed it counted that as a running training with 2000 steps taken. How? I don't have any idea. In fact I hadn't even moved 1cm from where I was.",Performance
"Please change the voice of that girl to somewhat motivated i.e. sharp, hard and loud",Usability

Amazing I love every single thing about it x me and my mate love it xx keep up he good work Samsung xx,Usability
Something changed. For the last few days this app has stopped recording my steps. Seems to be a problem since this activity tracking feature was added. This is why I gave it a low rating. UPDATE: 6/29/2017 - Everything works fine now. Putting the rating back up to 5 stars.,Usability
With the new update where are the steps and miles you walked? Uninstalled.,Usability
"Once the day is past,the app does store number of step taken yesterday. That is not good. They keep track yesterday yours but not steps.",Usability
