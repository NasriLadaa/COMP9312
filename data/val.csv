"meh, could be better.app takes hours to update",Performance
It is a great app but it wastes to much storage,Performance
Good app.. Please give solution also to overcome the trouble,Usability
Too many ads but it's a good app,Security
The max speed and max pace are so incorrect it's laughable.,Performance
Arbitrary 7 day cut offs for friends challenges are really annoying.,Usability
Won't connect to watch,Performance
An app that I don't need or want and can't be uninstalled.,Usability
Battery hog! Ate 30% battery in 6h today.,Performance
"forced apps are nothing but bloatware draining memory, battery and resources",Performance
It was working fine in 6.0 but aftrr upgrading to 7.0 it shows &quot; because of new security policy samsung health cant be opened on rooted devices. I have not rooted my device. It only stopped working after updating to 7.0,Security
"Lg privacy policy allows for reselling of both your medically relevant and non-relevant data to insurance companies. You might be fat or have an undiagnosed heart condition, either way, Higher Risk = Higher Premiums. Blame LG, Fitbit, Verizon and your own ignorance.",Security
Where is the ability to add height measurements?,Usability
My Pixel's step counter keeps overwriting my watches; Which is absolutely pointless considering my phone's sat on a desk and has minimal steps counted. Completely pointless and it never used to be like this on my GS7.,Performance
I have a Gear S3 and used this on my Sony Xperia Z2. Was one of the worst Apps for eating my phone battery .... so I removed it !!! Plus my Gear S3 battery life improved after that too.,Performance
Home screen need improvement. Activity tracking disabled info annoying. No activity graph on home screen.,Usability
Works well and lots of features. GUI is kinda a mess with respect to organizing so much data and kinds of data though.,Usability
Can't seem to integrate data from SHealth to Sleep as Android or Under Armour to indicate sleep stages,Usability
The new app is far too minimalistic with lots of empty space and you now have to scroll and change tabs a lot more to see all your statistics. The old app had a far better layout and didn't really need improving.,Usability
I don't need it just takes up space,Usability
"So, overall I really like the app :) it's very useful with a Samsung watch. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but with the &quot;measure stress&quot; feature, it seems that it always stops at 95% for me, I've tried maybe 5 times now and every time it just sticks on 95% :/ I don't remember it taking this long on a previous version of Samsung health, but maybe it's user error? I really don't know ^^;",Performance
"Great amazing app, just hate updates when they changes things around.",Usability
"I use this app daily and whilst it isn't perfect, it does a decent job of tracking my exercise without having to start and stop it all the time like most fitness apps.",Usability
"Do not use the video doctor call on this app. If you have issues with prescriptions, apparently, nobody can help. 3 phone calls and an email later, i am canceling my charge through the bank. Amwell has no record of the call. Yet, they charged my bank.",Usability
"Using public transport, but the app logs it as cycling.",Performance
"It's a great app, but doesn't work in my cellphone.",Usability
"Not very user friendly, could use a nice material design overhaul.. works and is pretty accurate so it's still a 4 star app",Usability
Please help me with the error that say's &quot;Health Services need to be updated&quot;.,Usability
I am not able to open this app after nougat update. Due to a security policy.,Security
I use the app mainly to keep track of my day to day activities it works well. Since last update however there is a link to sync which is for me unclickable don't know why but it's there,Usability
"New app looks better, works even worse. Disappointed.",Performance
Seriously not up to Google Par!! Can't record routes. Should be able to create a route using maps and upload so fit guides you. Can't share routes or accomplishments/results.,Usability
Waste of space doesn't sync well. Uninstalling.,Performance
"I think the scale is great. I also have a BP monitor and a Go activity tracker. Many of the extra features such as adding friends are connecting other apps are not easy to find or figure out. I feel it would be best to put all of the configurable app settings under settings. Instead, they are kind of hidden in different locations in the app. Also, adding two way data sharing with Google Fit and enabling Fit activity tracking would be a desirable feature.",Usability
I have an issue with logging!!,Usability
The app is good and I use it to monitor my heart rate but the recent in the bottom right is cut off on my moto 360. Needs some way to fit round watches better.,Usability
Fun app to track my weight. Somewhat confusing to use,Usability
The font isn't that big hard to read. Also no helpful information on how to acquire information with the calculators. In my opinion it is not user friendly!,Usability
Integrated with Knox. Now I can't use this app. This was for my medical aid and now I'm losing,Usability
I really dislike the look of the logo for this app. I don't get inspired by it at all.,Usability
Doesn't ask for permissions and doesn't say what permissions are required. As a result it doesn't do anything for me. Uninstalling.,Security
A good app EXCEPT it is a major battery drain. Runs continuously. Uninstalled,Performance
Often this application doesn't work if I open another application. Beside that the application is very good,Usability
No share result option. Significant battery drain,Performance
It's a great app. However I am unsure if steps are accurate as there's a difference in my Fitbit charge HR and this one. But I find this more useful.,Usability
"What's the point if every month for disables it's own activity tracking? I have it on, so LEAVE IT ON.",Performance
"It would not track my activity correctly, even though activity detection was always on. Some days it would record, other days it would only intermittently record movement. I'm very disappointed as it worked fine the first few months I had it (same device).",Performance
"It started out good, but all the sudden it starts reporting inaccurately. I'm sitting in my recliner and it's reporting that I'm walking. I ended up deleting the application. Fix this bug and I'll redownload.",Usability
Good app but drains battery,Performance
????? ?????? ?????? ?? ??,Usability
"To list a few: 1) Sometimes a days data suddenly disappears for a few days and reappears just as suddenly. 2) Data of some days shown in Hindi and others in English (Mobile default language is English). 3) When I start walking by 'start activity' nonstep count is shown, rest everything is shown including GPS data.",Performance
The biggest problem is the lag and how much processing power it takes to run this app. I also would like to be able to choose any workout on my Android wear instead of having to open the app on my phone.,Performance
"I loved this app until the recent update! Why did rhey make it harder to see my steps, miles, and calories burned! It all used to be there at the swipe of a screen! Now I have to open it and I still only get my steps! It ruined the app. Now I will have ro go third party and I didn't want that!",Usability
"The app had way too many ads pop up when not using it. Also, changed the way to unlock my phone with an ad on top. It did track steps, but have to have your phone on you 24/7 to be accurate. Not worth all the ads",Usability
The new design is great but it's lacking the detailed information the old app had. Would also like to see how many flights of steps I have done each day. More features would be great.,Usability
Crashed every single time through the set up process,Performance
All of my runs from mapmyrun show as hundreds of miles!,Usability
This thing is eating up my battery. The latest update. Pixel 2,Performance
The last few days it hasn't kept goals for more than a few hours and it erased over a month of weight data. I love this app but all of as sudden it's very hard to use,Usability
Brill i did one workout woke up next day with an 8 pack?,Usability
Why cant I get rid of this useless bloat... Should at least be able to disable it but nope your stuck with it even if you use a MUCH better program to do the same thing,Usability
"Doesn't open, I see the initial green front page and then it close. It would be nice to use it with my Samsung Gear 3, the only reason I bought it. I think this has happened after an update as I was avle to sign in the first time. But, now it's dead So, the best answer from Samsung is to call them ? Seriously ? I don't wanna spend the time and money calling a support team which can't help. Where is the help desk located? Manila ?",Performance
The daily tracking goals are cool but unless I manually open the app each day it's hit or miss if it starts tracking on its own.,Usability
Stopped synching with my scale months ago,Performance
Can be a little erratic at times but for the most part does what it promises.,Usability
"Not really accurate but I still love it, it has many cool features, I wish it would be more accurate in measuring distance.",Performance
IT won't allow to move from internal storage to sd card,Performance
