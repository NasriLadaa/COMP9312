Home screen need improvement. Activity tracking disabled info annoying. No activity graph on home screen.,Performance
Stopped working today. On opening just get a white screen. Have rebooted but no better.,Performance
I like the base original for steps. The update is difficult to use,Usability
"I really enjoy the app but it is sending me two weekly summaries, I get so confuse with it",Performance
Ever since it updated it keeps on crashing on me,Performance
New skin is a step backwards. Who thought making data lines really faint and adding stats that are inaccurate to the point of being wrong was good UX? Much preferred the withings version.,Usability
Why does the update need access to my SMSes and my phone ID etc?,Security
Awful new design. please adhere to google material design guidelines. This looks like a iPhone port. It disturbs my Android phone experience.,Usability
Fantastic,Security
Why there is no heart rate measurement when I download it?,Usability
"I truly do enjoy using this app.. I log just about everything but my meals in it. and the new world wide challenges are fun. but what I would love to ask is how the leader of the challenges is able to log in OVER 900,000 steps in just 3 days?",Usability
"I really enjoy the app but it is sending me two weekly summaries, I get so confuse with it",Usability
"Very disappointing support, i've a yearly subscription and cannot download March 2012 edition. Apple and WHM supports ping pong the issue instead of fixing it. After 8 e-mails they don't even reply except one line ""contact the other support"", what a real shame!",Usability
"The Fit app works fine on my Xperia Z3 compact and online in Chrome Beta, but is terrible on Galaxy S2 8&quot;, does not sync or display activity. Have just uninstalled the app.",Performance
Suddenly after software update there is an error poped up stating due to new security policy app cannot be opened. Disappointing,Security
"What a mess! The old version was fine, but this an unusable sprawled out ugly white mess. No landscape and unable to view trends as everything is so far apart.",Usability
"Nice app, but the graphs of for example weight is super hard to read. Please improve this :)",Usability
"meh, could be better.app takes hours to update",Performance
I like this app but the battery drain is shocking absolutely kills my battery.,Performance
"I really enjoy this app, but if it keeps giving me excessive notifications about this damn global challenge, I am going to disable it. 5 in less than that minutes? That's near spam!",Usability
The workout data is diappearing on its own...,Usability
"Lately it's been syncing really really slow, It takes forever. I usually have to readjust my time about once a month. Don't go soft on us, you are literally one of the very few programs that not only work, but are affordable, dependable & it looks like a watch! So I don't get asked those annoying &quot;do you work out?&quot; questions.",Performance
Probably less clear then before. Seems a little more performant though.,Usability
I can't connect to lenovo HW 01(smart band ),Usability
"How do I disable the Bluetooth connection notifications on my s6? It's not in the gear fit manager on the phone or on the watch settings and I can't find anything in app settings? I have the gear fit model sm-r350 and galaxy s6 phone sm-g920f with android 7. The annoying beep everytime it goes in or out of Bluetooth range, even in mute mode, has woken my baby up a few times. Apart from having Bluetooth permanently turned off what do you suggest?",Usability
Use Google guidelines for design. After Nokia branding it is hard to navigate. All this white empty space is pain for my eyes.,Usability
"I really enjoy the app but it is sending me two weekly summaries, I get so confuse with it",Usability
"This app worked great for a few days then stopped displaying the number of steps I was doing, just 4 fat zeroes at the top. I know it is counting them because I have it connected to Bounts and they show up on there. The timeline is always two days behind as well. Useless.",Performance
"The app will notify when I reach my goal, but it say something different and hour later.",Performance
"Won't talk to scales, fitbit hr or samsung s2 gear. Disappointed at lack of integration with common devices. Expected better.",Performance
I can't open the app. It tells &quot;Samsung Health can't be opened on a rooted device&quot;. Please help me fix the problem.Tha nks.,Usability
"Very bad experience especially after changing to Nokia, why it is asking for location?",Performance
Don't buy the scale. Don't get the app. Support takes days and for something fitness relates where everyday counts that is unacceptable. When you do get support the suggestions don't work. I'll try Tanita products.,Usability
"I think the scale is great. I also have a BP monitor and a Go activity tracker. Many of the extra features such as adding friends are connecting other apps are not easy to find or figure out. I feel it would be best to put all of the configurable app settings under settings. Instead, they are kind of hidden in different locations in the app. Also, adding two way data sharing with Google Fit and enabling Fit activity tracking would be a desirable feature.",Usability
"It's not the most useful app on the world, but that would be forgivable if it weren't so UGLY. The color palate is a total mess, and the artwork is oddly discomforting as well. What were they thinking?",Usability
Hate it ... wish I had MyTracks back ... this is not user friendly,Usability
Drained the LG20 battery very fast and made it unstable. Had to uninstall.,Performance
The GPS in this app is inaccurate. That's why you will get wrong distant and route. The pedometer won't count if you walk only in a small area. And you can't edit your weight.,Usability
I was biking and it would not let me save it to my log.... I hate it,Usability
"After the recent update, I can no longer track the 'Together' aspect of this app anymore. I can't take part in any of the challenges.",Usability
Because of a new security policy .... i hate u samsung ?,Security
The last few days it hasn't kept goals for more than a few hours and it erased over a month of weight data. I love this app but all of as sudden it's very hard to use,Usability
I can't use it because it shows a message that my S7 Edge is rooted but my ram is official not rooted. Nobody can help me?,Security
Need a watch app for android wear!!,Usability
Keep asking about enabling High accuracy mode every time I get into the app,Security
iit not alowing me to use it,Usability
Very unintuitive user interface. Can't see detailed information from past days. Terrible,Usability
Arbitrary 7 day cut offs for friends challenges are really annoying.,Usability
Its good but the only problem is that the gps works slow,Performance
"The app doesn't register certain meals towards the calorie balance. I'm not sure if it's a bug, or I'm doing something wrong.",Usability
"Lg privacy policy allows for reselling of both your medically relevant and non-relevant data to insurance companies. You might be fat or have an undiagnosed heart condition, either way, Higher Risk = Higher Premiums. Blame LG, Fitbit, Verizon and your own ignorance.",Security
Seems to be good App. Accuracy of the measurements needs to be apprehended.,Usability
"Quit putting retarded apps on my phone, that I can't uninstall.",Usability
Previous version was much easier to use and had better battery life,Usability
"The app has been updated, but the in app and site help content has not. I'm trying to find unknown measurements, but it's nowhere to be seen.",Usability
I love this app,Performance
"I'm facing problem Due to the new security policy , Samsung s health can't be opened",Security
"I don't want it, I don't need it, but I'm forced to have it!",Usability
"Utter garbage, just like the scales. The app is totally confusing, doesn't give a clear insight into progress. Awful when compaired to the Fitbit application, one saving grace being able to sync data to Fitbit. The scales randomly switch on, changing the measurement units, such a poor experience compaired to Fitbit.",Performance
"I generally love this app. But, after the latest update, it has been running extremely slowly on my Galaxy S7. It also freezes for seconds to nearly minutes at a time before finally syncing my steps, food, exercise, etc.",Performance
Spyware. Reinstalls itself.,Security
"Too many things missing to make it good. Needs health sensors such as heart beat. Needs dietary knowledge, etc. The list of missing . compared to Samsung health is endless",Usability
Drained the LG20 battery very fast and made it unstable. Had to uninstall.,Performance
Good app but drains battery,Performance
Where the widget ?,Usability
This update version sucks I don't like or understand it. I really enjoyed the latest version. I unstalled google fit and it really help me and encourage me to keep going. ??,Usability
"The Fit app works fine on my Xperia Z3 compact and online in Chrome Beta, but is terrible on Galaxy S2 8&quot;, does not sync or display activity. Have just uninstalled the app.",Performance
The app does not connect to MyFitnessPal and does not seem to sync with Google Fit.,Usability
Hard to find stuff. Old app 1000000% better!! Only had watch for a month now starting to look for new option when battery run out.,Performance
"I lost 30 lbs since buying my scale 6 years ago. I always disliked that the weight graph used my highest weight at the top of the scale. That is still there, but now the bottom is 100 lbs below my weight. All I get is a wiggly line across the graph. Let ME choose the upper and lower limits of the scale. The latest update also took away the double tap to expand the graph to 1 month and 1 week. Put it back. The weight graph does not appear in the screen captures above. I guess you're not proud of it either.",Usability
"How come the units of height and weight are fixed on lb and ft only? I dont use this units and i have to set my height and weight according to them when making my account, and after changing the units i couldnt update my height and weight, epic fail actually",Usability
It is not very accurate when counting your steps some days it only starts counting my steps at about 3 in the after noon,Performance
Very unintuitive user interface. Can't see detailed information from past days. Terrible,Usability
Still needs support for automatic heart rate checks. Also graph scaling is too aggressive and makes them almost unreadable.,Usability
Is it me or is there a problem with they WiFi connection? It's also giving me issues with the location,Performance
Keep asking about enabling High accuracy mode every time I get into the app,Usability
App looks pretty but isn't accurate at all.,Performance
Solid app with little configuration necessary to give you health insights and trends,Usability
"I lost 30 lbs since buying my scale 6 years ago. I always disliked that the weight graph used my highest weight at the top of the scale. That is still there, but now the bottom is 100 lbs below my weight. All I get is a wiggly line across the graph. Let ME choose the upper and lower limits of the scale.

I guess you're not proud of it either.",Usability
"I compared this app go S Health. This app doesn't keep an accurate step count. It was off as many as 2000 steps. It looks cool, but that's about it.",Performance
It was working fine in 6.0 but aftrr upgrading to 7.0 it shows &quot; because of new security policy samsung health cant be opened on rooted devices. I have not rooted my device. It only stopped working after updating to 7.0,Security
The app is failing to connect to my Aura device. I cannot even set the clock or alarm. Now I have a glorified bedside lamp. I feel a bit cheated here.,Performance
The apps integration is supremely annoying. And thinks ive reached my goals just driving anywhere,Usability
You upgraded this app without my permission I was using Nokia just fine. The new app which I have uninstalled several times sucks .does not tell me how far I have walked in a day. Killometers or miles. And is too faint too read. I'm thinking of just giving it op,Performance
Runs in background and kills my battery. Also a lot of functions are missing since Nokia bought Withings. Not sure if I will buy there gadgets again.,Performance
Still embarrassingly slowly to load.,Performance
It won't sync with myfitnesspal anymore. Kinda makes that part useless. Also won't sync weight with myfitnesspal which it says it will.,Usability
I love The app but I don't have the discover and the expert in my app I don't why. So I want an explanation please to make me understand. Thank you,Usability
All am asking for is to show what is the stuff we dont understand through videos and pictures,Usability
Battery consumption of my phone rate more than doubled since installing this.,Performance
The Withing app actually worked. Updated to this Nokia crap and now my Steel HR doesn't sync. How do I go back to the old app.,Performance
Quit working after about a week. Won't track steps or connect to carrot rewards or run tracker anymore,Performance
This app used to work great now it can't seem to track my heart rate while I'm sitting in a chair AFTER I completely uninstalled then reinstalled it. Would love a fix but for now must use a different app.,Usability
"I love everything that Google produces and releases but this felt inferior to everything else out there and didn't feel accurate. The interface was annoying to me, but that's just my opinion. I felt restricted, there just wasn't enough freedom.",Usability
I tested it to see how accurate it was. Took about 20 steps and it didn't count a single one. No one it's count is 500 behind Samsung's Step Counter. Now I will not get my Scene points with Carrot because Fit is not counting my steps correctly. This is extremely upsetting.,Performance
"It's good app for fitness , but measure problem is it that it drain too much battery",Performance
Good . Not that accurate but near about accurate.,Performance
"Utterly disappointed with this app. When i first started to use with my gear fit you could see hourly how many steps you've taken, now its just a graph with a total. Previously you could track your sleep cycle, now it just records what time you went to sleep and woke up so pretty useless.",Usability
"I've tried on both my Nexus 7 & Droid Razr M, but neither will sync data at all, even though it's described that it should happen automatically. All of my stats sit at 0, though they are different on the actual Pulse device. Please update, developer.",Performance
Not tracking cycling,Usability
"Whatever happened to &quot;if it's notbroke, don't fix it&quot;...We don't need all the cutesee cartoon like graphics trying to convey whatever you aren't getting across. I can't even figure out how to set a darn alarm on my watch! Nokia, you have ruined this app.",Usability
"Hate the newer version.The auto- talking is obnoxious and I can't turn it off. It's like going for a walk with a robot, when all I want is some peace and quiet. Downloaded a different app. This one drove me nuts.",Usability
It stopped working and I cannot get it to restart so I'm uninstalling it.,Usability
I used to like this app. Now everytime I try to use it it hangs up my phone. It takes too long to input or record my workouts or to even push start on a workout. It's worthless if it's going to take that long. I do hope you read these inputs.,Performance
What has happened to the weight graph. My weight on the dashboard is correct but the graph shows I only weigh 11lbs. Please fix asap.,Usability
Its not tracking steps properly for me. Everytime I have to update steps manually,Usability
Not able to connect.,Usability
Home screen need improvement. Activity tracking disabled info annoying. No activity graph on home screen.,Usability
Might be useful or right info.. but not at the cost of annoying someone with irrelevant ads (U'll hate to the core) from this category of highly useful app. This should be improved.,Usability
Still embarrassingly slowly to load.,Performance
You should be able to uninstall & remove the application off your phone if the person has no use 4 it at all ..Even my so called smart cleaning can't get rid of the app. ??,Usability
Remove weekly notification,Usability
"The app stuck on check your user data screen. Can't get pass that, save option does nothing gives short notification please wait while we refresh your data. Please fix! Hey all fixed with new update!",Usability
"This app is killing my battery. Using more resources than my screen! I have to force stop this app every time I open it to sync, because if I don't, my battery drains! Verizon Moto X 4.4.3",Usability
Omg What a slow speed app,Performance
"Well, I like everything about it except for the fact that it doesn't work.",Performance
"I downloaded app and opened for very first time, it is unable to fetch my gmail account.",Usability
It's great but there is always an issue with syncing data with the server,Performance
Visuals lacking.. Good text info,Usability
"It's very nice to use and simple to understand. As a Healthcare major, I really don't like the numbers you use for heart rate. For general heart rate, don't put average resting range 66-82; it should be 60-100 as an acceptable rate . Before excerise shouldn't have the same numbers as resting because your heart actually pumps harder to prepare you for excerise. Just got a new update on my phone, which changed the manual entree for treadmill (and probably others). I can only input hours and minutes, seconds isn't an option anymore. I like having seconds to know if I'm improving, even it's just a little bit.. Please change these issues for a better rating! Update: Thank you for responding! One other thing that could make things easier. For treadmill, if I track it with a time, I can't enter my distance at the end yet when I enter manually I can enter my distance & time. Yet tracking gives me the voice during my run",Usability
It's awesome,Usability
Cool,Usability
It eat a lot of battery usage on my Nexus 6p,Usability
What happened to being able to enter data manually? Without it the app is useless if you don't have your phone for some reason during a workout.,Usability
Still takes ages to start whenever it starts.,Performance
But it doesn't work on 2g net. It would be fantastic if it functioned a little better on slower connections.,Performance
(Can't open the app in rooted devices due to new security policy) My phone is not rooted and please give me a reply how to fix it..,Security
Wrong information,Usability
Need a way to turn off notifications.,Usability
Nice update...?....But accuracy is not upto mark....,Performance
Seriously?! No ability to share my activity on social media? If there is I can't see it anywhere so either way it's very poor,Usability
Keeps crashing and is unable to log into my account data,Usability
"Nice app but the continuous reminders and notifications, even after I've disabled notifications, is just irritating. The usual where an app developer feels they know better what the user wants, notifications and badge icons are great but give me the option of removing them if I choose!",Usability
doesn't support Previously rooted device,Performance
When I take it off the charger of a morning it has already logged 2000 to 3000 steps. Just lying still on the table. Not in any way accurate!,Performance
Cool app,Security
Works well and lots of features. GUI is kinda a mess with respect to organizing so much data and kinds of data though.,Usability
You don't need my contacts or my location. Stop asking.,Security
Just wrnt for a 2 mile run. The app tracked it at 5.5 miles. Other times it won't track at all or will minus my distance. Not very accurate.,Performance
"Must be one of the least intuitive apps in the store. Hard to update any value, measurements don't come through. Can't believe I just paid 120 pounds for this.",Performance
"It reset all of my custom goals, and it keeps reseting them.",Usability
I subscribed to this magazine because I thought I would get the iPad version with my subscription. I did not. I will not pay additional cash to get the same mag. What is with this?????,Usability
"Can't set my personal details, height, weight etc. Even though it says it linked to Strava rides aren't being displayed.",Usability
Counts steps but no time or distance for three days now,Performance
I forgot password! How do I change it!! Help,Security
Useless waste of space on my phone that cannot be uninstalled.,Performance
"Not bad, but sometimes it doesn't sync correctly. It'll tell me that I've walked far less than I know that I have even with high accuracy. Lately the app seems slow and laggy, which may be the cause of this.",Performance
"Just like a whole lot of people, I am confined to a wheelchair ?",Usability
Full of ads and that is a problem....but everything else is very great indeed.?,Usability
Can't use it.,Usability
App is Good but not sure about the accuracy. Had to check with consultant..,Security
Very unintuitive user interface. Can't see detailed information from past days. Terrible,Usability
My Steel HR is no longer receiving any notifications. I have all the correct permissions set and the notifications enabled. This is very frustrating. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. What can I do to get my text/call/calendar notifications back?,Usability
"Great app, yet battery drains quickly",Performance
"It used to give a nice, unique goal achieved reward cheer. Now it uses the boring general alerts. I am looking for another app and not happy that I can't uninstall this one. :-(",Usability
Too many ads but it's a good app,Security
I loved this app and used it every day. However the latest update makes my weight a flat line because I am unable to zoom to see a range of 10 lbs. My husband is using 6.01 on a nexus5x and his works fine. I am using 6.0 on a LG v10 and mine sucks. Please look into services that run your app on multiple devices. This is really annoying.,Usability
Hreat but how to use vision check plz explain,Usability
Doesn't consistently sync with connected apps. Very frustrating.,Usability
"It really needs to be an option I can force it to never turn off after some inactivity. Need heart rate support for watches, that should be standard and well integrated to periodically poll heart rate and set as a goal",Security
"I generally love this app. But, after the latest update, it has been running extremely slowly on my Galaxy S7. It also freezes for seconds to nearly minutes at a time before finally syncing my steps, food, exercise, etc.",Performance
Tracking worse than before,Performance
It's ok but too much hassle to go around the houses to do the food diary. Half the stuff I have isn't listed and to try and put it in is just to complicated. Other than that it's not too bad.,Usability
"Good if social angle is added e.g. show people cycling on the same route, add route wise speed and distance rankings...",Usability
Very bright very nice,Security
"I like this app. But I sit here for 10 solid minutes, trying to get a stress reading, and it never finishes. I don't have the time to wait longer to get a reading.",Usability
