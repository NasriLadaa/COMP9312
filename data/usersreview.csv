"It really needs to be an option I can force it to never turn off after some inactivity. Need heart rate support for watches, that should be standard and well integrated to periodically poll heart rate and set as a goal",Security
"The calorie tracking has major issues. I want it to work as a concept, but how can it when it can't even simply add numbers. I enter a meal, it shows up under my total calories for the day. The meal also shows up in the weight loss module, but it's not totalled into the total comparison of calories consumed vs burned. Maybe Samsung needs to go back to the drawing board and master basic arithmetic before they make apps.",Performance
"The logging of walking and weight seem to work fairly well, but adding activity is almost random and has gotten worse in the new version. When I add time for martial arts it used to waffle between a 1 calorie a minute to some really high number. The latest version just send to treat it as 0 calories no matter how long I do it. Not being able to account for my primary activity makes it worthless.",Usability
