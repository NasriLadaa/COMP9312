	Implementation notes:

	Note: we may need some synchronization in here

	Note on version dependency:  This base class is JDK 1.1 compatible,
	however we are forced to use weak references in the full featured
	implementation (the optional bsh.classpath package) to accomodate all of
	the fleeting namespace listeners as they fall out of scope.  (NameSpaces
	must be informed if the class space changes so that they can un-cache
	names).  
	<p>

	Perhaps a simpler idea would be to have entities that reference cached
	types always perform a light weight check with a counter / reference
	value and use that to detect changes in the namespace.  This puts the 
	burden on the consumer to check at appropriate times, but could eliminate
	the need for the listener system in many places and the necessity of weak 
	references in this package.
